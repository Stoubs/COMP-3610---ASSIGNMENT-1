# COMP-3610---ASSIGNMENT-1
This repository contains my submission for COMP3610 – Assignment 1. The project analyzes the January 2024 NYC Yellow Taxi dataset using Polars and DuckDB for data cleaning, transformation, and SQL-based analysis. It includes exploratory analysis in a Jupyter notebook and a fully functional interactive Streamlit dashboard that visualizes key taxi patterns.

The workflow covers:

Data ingestion and cleaning using Polars

Feature engineering (trip duration, pickup hour, day of week, etc.)

SQL analysis using DuckDB

Development of an interactive Streamlit dashboard with filters and visualizations

Deployment via Streamlit Community Cloud

The dashboard provides insights into trip volume, fare patterns, payment type distribution, and pickup-dropoff zone behavior across different time dimensions.
